\title{\textbf{Fano Factor for Different Mutation Rate Control Systems}}
\date{\today}
\author{Yotam Lifschytz}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

We aim to devise a experimental process that can distinguish between a number of feasible hypothetical control systems for the mutation rates per base-pair in a bacterial population.
To this end we will incorporate fluctuation tests as inspired by the Luria-Delbruck experiment, looking at the Fano factor(FF) of the number of mutants in a population.
The FF of some RV X is defined as the ratio of the variance of X to its mean, i.e. $F(X) = \frac{\text{Var}(X)}{\text{E}(X)}$.
We assume these control are not directly implemented genetically, for instance through variation in the genes responsible for DNA repair.
Instead, these control system may be implemented epigenetically, or perhaps through phenotypic(expression) fluctuations and hereditary with some memory length.
