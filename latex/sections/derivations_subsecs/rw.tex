Assuming some hereditary process of mutation rate which accumulates noise, we are looking at a process of diffusion,
with certain specific boundary conditions.
First of all, the mutation rate cannot be negative, so we have reflecting boundary conditions at 0.
Secondly, one assumes that for some high rate $\mu_c$, when one has \(\mu > \mu_c \) the individual is likely not to survive, resulting in absorbing boundary conditions at $\mu_c$.
So, we can simply solve the diffusion equation with these boundary conditions:
